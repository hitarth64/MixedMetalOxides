# Directory contains data on Mixed Metal Oxide surfaces

* All the calculations were performed on VASP using PBE+U xc-functional 

* The U-values used are borrowed from [MPRelaxSet](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/blob/master/pymatgen/io/vasp/MPRelaxSet.yaml)

* All calculations were performed with an energy convergence crtierion of 0.0001 eV and the force convergence criterion was 0.03 eV/â„«. 

* The k-points grid used was [3x2x1]
